# My Blog Using one to many relationship <br>
- This is a simple blog Website, Where Admin can post an article.<br> 
- Admin can do all the CRUD operations. Creating a blog, deleting and updating.<br>
- The authentic users can comment on the article. <br>
- The non user can only read the article but cannot leave a comment. <br>
- Two Models have been used one for post and other for leaving a comment. The relationship between these two models are one to many relationship. Which means
a post can have many comments but comments can have only post.<br>
- View Model has been used in the two models so it can get all the data and view it in the razor pages.<br>
- Right now only logical part is done. Desgning will be soon done when i am done with my final project.<br>![comment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73182090/177768675-b07d8643-b216-488b-9713-359ac3ac560f.png)
